# Migration notes

CrowdyPy is pre-1.0. Within a minor line, patch releases keep source compatibility; each
new minor may change the API. Read the section for every minor you skip.

## 0.1.0

The first release. CrowdyPy follows CrowdyJS 18.0.4 (the pinned commit in
`pyproject.toml`) the way CrowdyCPP does, and runs its native core on CrowdyCPP 0.53.0.

- **The client.** `AsyncCrowdyClient` (asyncio) and its generated blocking twin
  `CrowdyClient`, one origin, the two-token model, the full CrowdyJS error hierarchy
  (`CrowdyGraphQLError.code`, `CrowdyAppUnavailableError`, `CrowdyUserCodeFaultError`
  with `player_fault_of`), the `WRONG_DATACENTER` move with one retry, the sticky
  load-balancer cookie and endpoint re-discovery (`discovery_url`).
- **Names.** Every CrowdyJS method is the snake_case of its name (`mintAppToken` ->
  `mint_app_token`, `listConnection` -> `list_connection`); domains likewise
  (`client.appAccess` -> `client.app_access`). `register` and `delete` keep their names.
- **Big integers** are decimal strings on the wire, as everywhere on the platform; methods
  accept `int` or `str` for a `BigInt` argument and send the string.
- **Typed results where they carry credentials.** `auth.login` returns `AuthResponse` and
  `portal.mint_app_token` / `refresh` / `exchange_code` return `AppTokenResponse`; their
  reprs never show the token. Other results are plain `dict`s, decoded with msgspec.
- **Inputs** are generated msgspec structs (`crowdypy.inputs`); a plain mapping keyed by the
  GraphQL field names works too.
- **The wire codec** (`crowdypy.wire`) is CrowdyCPP's, byte-identical to CrowdyJS's
  serializer on the shared fixtures.
- **Grid scope.** `client.grid(app_id, grid_id)` returns a `GridScope`: `mint_token()` (which
  learns the grid box), `contains()` / `assert_contains()` (raising `GridScopeError`) and the
  grid's channels. Its replication sends (`send.*`, `channels.send`) arrive with the
  connection in 0.2.0.
- **A response without its root field** raises `CrowdyProtocolError`, where CrowdyJS hands
  back `undefined`.
- **Licenses.** The wheels link OpenSSL statically, so the distribution is
  `MIT AND Apache-2.0`; every license ships in the wheel's metadata.
- **Not in a non-browser SDK** (as in CrowdyCPP): hosted browser sign-in navigation
  (`portal.signIn`, `handleSignInCallback`, `handleAuthorizeRequest`), the Crowdy Games
  shell bridge and bundle hosting, the Studio browser UI, the in-browser agent pane and the
  Web Worker player runtime. `docs/parity-matrix.md` lists every exclusion with its reason.

Not in 0.1.0, and listed as portable gaps in `docs/parity-matrix.md` until they land:
the native replication connection, video frames and traffic metrics (0.2.0); the World
Stores, the ck-exec gateway connection, the Game Kit and the subscriptions client (0.3.0);
the headless Studio, and the roots CrowdyCPP covers beyond CrowdyJS (0.4.0).
